我觉得及时性和健壮性就是两个相互矛盾的设计目的,及时性要求它反应快,那么它结构一定要简单,高效,二健壮性要求它稳定,那么就一定需要一堆处理意外情况的冗余代码,os就变得复杂,大,及时性会减弱.









Consider fairness and real time. Fairness requires that each process be allo-
cated its resources in a fair way, with no process getting more than its fair
share. On the other hand, real time requires that resources be allocated based
on the times when different processes must complete their execution. A real-
time process may get a disproportionate(不相称,不平衡) share of the resources.
