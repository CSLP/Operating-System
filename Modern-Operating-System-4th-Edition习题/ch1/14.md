1000000000;十的九次方







Every nanosecond one instruction emerges(浮现,暴露) from the pipeline. This means the
machine is executing 1 billion instructions per second. It does not matter at all
how many stages the pipeline has. A 10-stage pipeline with 1 nsec per stage
would also execute 1 billion instructions per second. All that matters is how
often a finished instruction pops out the end of the pipeline.
