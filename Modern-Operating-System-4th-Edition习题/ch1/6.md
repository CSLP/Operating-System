访问IO设备的指令要通过IO设备驱动来执行,而IO设备驱动多工作在内核态,所以这些指令时特权指令.
* 以前的那个答案等于什么也没说,为什么进行io要特权,因为本质上来讲,人和计算机的交互就是IO,对于多用户计算机而言,每个用户坑定想自己进行尽可能多的IO,完成自己的任务,所以需要管理员来分配,所以IO需要特权,不然每个人都会安排自己先IO.















Access to I/O devices (e.g., a printer) is typically restricted for different users.
Some users may be allowed to print as many pages as they like, some users
may not be allowed to print at all, while some users may be limited to printing
only a certain number of pages. These restrictions are set by system adminis-
trators based on some policies. Such policies need to be enforced(强制执行) so that user-
level programs cannot interfere with them.
