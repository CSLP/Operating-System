cpu管理IO,当前作业在IO的时候,多道程序则cpu可以先去做别的作业,待这个作业IO完成后在转回头做这个.












The prime reason for multiprogramming is to give the CPU something to do
while waiting for I/O to complete. If there is no DMA, the CPU is fully occu-
pied doing I/O, so there is nothing to be gained (at least in terms of CPU utili-
zation) by multiprogramming. No matter how much I/O a program does, the
CPU will be 100% busy. This of course assumes the major delay is the wait
while data are copied. A CPU could do other work if the I/O were slow for
other reasons (arriving on a serial line, for instance).
