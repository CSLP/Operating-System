有理由啊,可能那个文件系统安装在这个非空目录下便于管理.mount 即可.








Mounting a file system makes any files already in the mount-point directory
inaccessible, so mount points are normally empty. Howev er, a system adminis-
trator might want to copy some of the most important files normally located in
the mounted directory to the mount point so they could be found in their nor-
mal path in an emergency when the mounted device was being repaired.
