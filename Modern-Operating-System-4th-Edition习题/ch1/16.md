当写磁盘时,调用者发出写的命令之后就可以继续执行了.可能写命令之后就是马上又读这部分,就得阻塞了,因为这部分可能还没写完,但是写有驱动器负责,写完后在让它读.











Maybe. If the caller gets control back and immediately overwrites the data,
when the write finally occurs, the wrong data will be written. However, if the
driver first copies the data to a private buffer before returning, then the caller
can be allowed to continue immediately. Another possibility is to allow the
caller to continue and give it a signal when the buffer may be reused, but this
is tricky and error prone.
