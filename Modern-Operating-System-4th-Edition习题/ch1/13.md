20ms










It may take 20, 25 or 30 msec to complete the execution of these programs de-
pending on how the operating system schedules them. If P0 and P1 are sched-
uled on the same CPU and P2 is scheduled on the other CPU, it will take 20
msec. If P0 and P2 are scheduled on the same CPU and P1 is scheduled on the
other CPU, it will take 25 msec. If P1 and P2 are scheduled on the same CPU
and P0 is scheduled on the other CPU, it will take 30 msec. If all three are on
the same CPU, it will take 35 msec.
注意所谓线程,OS把他们看做一个cpu,然而他们并不是,只是cpu在线程之间不断切换而已,一个线程运行一个程序,两个线程的程序所用时间跟一个线程运行两个程序的时间是一样的,并不是真正的并行,只有多核多cpu才是.
