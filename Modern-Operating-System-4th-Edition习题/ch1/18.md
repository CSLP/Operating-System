分时系统有不同的用户,每个进程属于不同的用户,所以需要进程表加以记录和管理.而后者只有一个进程则不需要










The process table is needed to store the state of a process that is currently sus-
pended, either ready or blocked. Modern personal computer systems have
dozens of processes running even when the user is doing nothing and no pro-
grams are open. They are checking for updates, loading email, and many other
things, On a UNIX system, use the ps -a command to see them. On a Windows
system, use the task manager.
