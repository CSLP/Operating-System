局部性原理,当前需要的那一条指令周围的指令接下来更有可能被用到,所以一次缓存一整行.










Empirical(经验) evidence shows that memory access exhibits the principle of locality
of reference, where if one location is read then the probability of accessing
nearby locations next is very high, particularly the following memory loca-
tions. So, by caching an entire cache line, the probability of a cache hit next is
increased. Also, modern hardware can do a block transfer of 32 or 64 bytes
into a cache line much faster than reading the same data as individual words.
