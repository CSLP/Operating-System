所谓可移植的os,无非就是适配不同的硬件系统体系结构,可以适应不同硬件结构带来的不同的接口.这与强行把两个os合起来没有什么不同,增加了很大的复杂度,没有意义.  
* 我设计的两个层次无非是一个选择判断层次,不同的硬件系统结构有不同的一套逻辑.一套 优化逻辑.















Every system architecture has its own set of instructions that it can execute.
Thus a Pentium cannot execute SPARC programs and a SPARC cannot ex-
ecute Pentium programs. Also, different architectures differ in bus architecture
used (such as VME, ISA, PCI, MCA, SBus, ...) as well as the word size of the
CPU (usually 32 or 64 bit). Because of these differences in hardware, it is not
feasible(可行的) to build an operating system that is completely portable. A highly
portable operating system will consist of two high-level layers—-a ma-
chine-dependent layer and a machine-independent layer. The ma-
chine-dependent layer addresses the specifics of the hardware and must be im-
plemented separately for every architecture. This layer provides a uniform in-
terface on which the machine-independent layer is built. The machine-inde-
pendent layer has to be implemented only once. To be highly portable, the size
of the machine-dependent layer must be kept as small as possible.
