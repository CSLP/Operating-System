正常的啊,调用库过程好像就是在调用系统调用一样.








System calls do not really have names, other than in a documentation sense.
When the library procedure read traps to the kernel, it puts the number of the
system call in a register or on the stack. This number is used to index into a ta-
ble. There is really no name used anywhere. On the other hand, the name of
the library procedure is very important, since that is what appears in the pro-
gram.
