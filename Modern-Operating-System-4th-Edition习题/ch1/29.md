Several UNIX calls have no counterpart in the Win32 API:
Link : a Win32 program cannot refer to a file by an alternative name or see it in
more than one directory. Also, attempting to create a link is a convenient way
to test for and create a lock on a file.
Mount and umount : a Windows program cannot make assumptions about stan-
dard path names because on systems with multiple disk drives the drive-name
part of the path may be different.
Chmod : Windows uses access control lists.
Kill : Windows programmers cannot kill a misbehaving program that is not co-
operating.
