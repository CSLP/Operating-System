* fork:父进程不存在  
* exec:子进程不存在;要替换的文件不存在即参数错误  
* unlink:目录项不存在;








Fork can fail if there are no free slots left in the process table (and possibly if
there is no memory or swap space left). Exec can fail if the file name given
does not exist or is not a valid executable file. Unlink can fail if the file to be
unlinked does not exist or the calling process does not have the authority to
unlink it.
