个人觉得有必要把,这样程序员可以知道什么操作执行了系统调用,尤其是在安全性要求严格的程序中,一定要考虑减少系统调用或者谨慎使用











As far as program logic is concerned, it does not matter whether a call to a li-
brary procedure results in a system call. But if performance is an issue, if a
task can be accomplished without a system call the program will run faster.
Every system call involves overhead time in switching from the user context to
the kernel context. Furthermore, on a multiuser system the operating system
may schedule another process to run when a system call completes, further
slowing the progress in real time of a calling process.
